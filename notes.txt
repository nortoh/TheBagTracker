I place a transaction
	- 9/25/21
	- BTC/USD
	- Buy
	- 10 BTC - $424835.00 (1 BTC = 42483.50)
	- $1000
	- Coinbase

I view transaction 9/28/21 - BTC $50000
	Profit: (10 * $50000) - ($424835.00) = (Amount * Curr_price) - (Price_Bought * Amount)

What do we need when we are adding a transaction?
* Date of transaction being filed
* Base Pair
* Quote Pair
* Date of transaction made
* Amount: How much did we buy
* Type: BUY/SELL
* Fee: What was the fee on the transaction?
